Course Objectives:
    - Developing rigorous treatment.
    - Developing mathematical foundations to CS.
    - Building intuition.
    - Linking to CS applications.
Good resources for analysis of algorithms are:
    1- Rosen (2007), which we follow.
    2- Knuth (1997), an indispensable resource.
    3- Mahmoud (1992, 2000), for probabilistic analysis of sorting and
       random search trees.
The Growth of Functions
    - Used extensively to analyze algorithms.
    - How algorithms behave with large size input?
    - Algorithm A takes 100 n^2 + 17 n + 4 steps; Algorithm B takes
      n^3; which is faster?
    - Big-O(big-oh) notation.
    - Big-O was used by mathematicicans Edmund landau and Paul Bachmann
      then introduced to computer science by Knuth.
