Function Call Stack:
    - Stack space: The StackEntry is a struct of variables and return
      address of each function.
    - All local parameters and return address of each function has to be
      stored.
    - Return is in LIFO order.
    - Space required is the height of the tree (function call tree).
    - OS has to use a stack to keep track of this storage sequence.
    - When a function calls itself, this is recursion.
    - Still stack is needed, no difference between A call B, or B calls
      itself.
    - The stack size is the depth of the tree.
    - The number of calls, which determines the complexity and the
      execution time, is the number of nodes in the tree.
