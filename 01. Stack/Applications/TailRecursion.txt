Tail Recursion
Last statement in a function is a call to itself.

No need to keep the space of the function in the stack, since it will
return to itself. So, just pass the new parameters to the function itself.
This reduces the stack size not the complexity of the algorithm.

This call can be eliminated by reassigning the calling parameters to
the values specified in the recursive call, and then repeating the whole
function.
