Motivation: Why Lists?

In a general list:
    - New values are added in position determined by the user.
    - Element is removed from a position determined by the user.

Important notice:
    - If we keep adding and removing from the first position (the
      head of the list) the general list will behave as a stack.

    - If we keep adding from one end and removing from another
      end the list will behave as a queue.

Application:
    - In queues, sometimes we need a priority for some elements.
      We may need to put an emergency call prior to others.
