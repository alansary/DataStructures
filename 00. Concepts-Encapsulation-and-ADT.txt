Information Hiding (Encapsulation):

    - The use of functions. You use the structure at the "User Level"
      without caring about the details at the "Implementation Level".

    - Your program, i.e., the user level, does not change even if the
      implementation of the used structure is changed.

    - Your program is clear from the logical point of view.

    - Enhancing the Top-Down-Design (We build the foundations first).

Definitions, where every thing should start from!

Definition: type is a set of values and a set of operations on those
            values.

Definition: A Sequence of length 0 is empty, A sequence of length
            n >= 1 of elements from a set T is an ordered pair (sn-1, t)
            where sn-1 is a sequence of length n-1 of elements from T and
            t is an element of T.

Definition: Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a data type that is accessed only
            through an interface (or Accessing mechanism). We refer to a
            program that uses an ADT as a client (or user) and a program
            that specifies the data type as an implementation.
