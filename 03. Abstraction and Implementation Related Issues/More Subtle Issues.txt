More subtle issues and some answers: We just open the door for deeper
thinking and robust design

Much more of these issues are out of the scope of our course. They are
classified as low-level Software Engineering aspects.

Also, solutions to these issues are languages dependent. E.g., the
definition of the structure completely disappeared from the header file
by defining a pointer to an undefined structure. In some languages, e.g.,
Java, this is not available since there is no pointers.
