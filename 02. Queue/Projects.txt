Simulation is the use of one system to imitate the behavior of
another system. A computer simulation is a program to imitate
the behavior of the system under study.

1. The same runway is used for both landings and takeoffs.
2. One plane can land or take off in a unit of time, but not both.
3. A random number of planes arrive in each time unit.
4. A plane waiting to land goes before one waiting to take off.
5. The planes that are waiting are kept in queues landing and
   takeoff, both of which have a strictly limited size.
